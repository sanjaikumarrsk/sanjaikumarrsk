👨‍💻 About Me
I’m an AI & Data Science student who enjoys building meaningful software and understanding how systems work behind the scenes.  
I work primarily with Java and Spring Boot, and I like turning problem statements into structured, working solutions.  

Beyond technical skills, I value clear communication, teamwork, and consistency.  
I’m a quick learner, comfortable taking responsibility, and I enjoy collaborating with people who are passionate about technology and growth.
